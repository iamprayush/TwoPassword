# Roadmap
### Some of the functionalities that can be added to this project are:
- The master password generation URL is currently directly accessible (althought not from the UI). There could be a way to only be able to access this endpoint from the redirection triggered via the password reveal endpoint.
- The configurations for the random password generation could be added to the UI for a more dynamic functionality.
- Email verification while registration.
- Editing a password entry. This could have same restrictions as viewing a password, ie, ask for the master password before allowing edits.
- Find a way to store the passwords in an encrypted form and still be able to allow the master user to view them.
- UI improvements.
